## Spring Quarter

- Add paddle-to-ball distance to the observation vector  
- Verify that latent vectors vary across the entire dataset  
- Train an agent to break even so the dataset is not biased (scores were ~20 for AI, 0 for agent) ✅ 
- Inject random noise into the VAE decoder and observe outputs  
- Visualize the dataset’s average latent vector  
- Introduce dropout  

## 9/16

- Model the delay as a buffer, not as NO-OP. The buffer should start with NO-OP and queue actions as it goes.
- Model observation delay.
